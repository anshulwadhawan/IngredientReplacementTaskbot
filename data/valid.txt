Bring water and salt to a boil in a large pot.
When it boils, add the cornmeal all in one go, mix, cover and cook undisturbed over very gentle heat for about 30 - 60 minutes.
That is the method a black lady I know always used (although she didn't measure a thing, but neither do I, when I make pap).
It gets to be easy after a few times, just pouring a small stream of cornmeal into the boiling water and stirring.
You know when the consistency will be to your liking.
I find it easier, and safer for the final smoothness, to stir or whisk while I pour in the dry cornmeal.
(Cornmeal in Africa is known as maize meal or mealie meal.
White cornmeal is preferred by African peoples, and it's a bad year for corn when producers have to add yellow corn to the white in order to produce enough of the product for the market).
As pap is bland and merely a vehichle for other tastes, it is always eaten with a savory soup or stew or sauce.
A favourite meal among Black and White alike is pap with tomato-and-onion sauce, with grilled meats alongside.
But where the eaters have to make do with little, a sauce or soupy stew will suffice.

In mixer bowl measure out first portion of flour with yeast.
In a measuring cup measure water, add milk butter and oil.
Microwave for around 1min30sec until it reaches 125'F.
Use an instant test thermometer.
While it's in the mic measure out the flour, sugar, and salt in another bowl.
Add the 125'F liquid to the flour and yeast in the mixer and mix away.
I use speed 2 on a Kitchenaid stand mixer using a standard dough hook.
Add the large flour portion 1 spoon full at a time till it's absorbed, then add another spoonful.
Use it all up.
If you need a bit more flour at the end to clean the side of the bowl and make the dough not stick add a bit at a time.
Continue kneeding for 10-15minutes.
Once done kneed dough by hand into a ball, cover and let rest 10 minutes.
This gives you time to prepare the pan, ingredients, etc -- I put a pizza stone into a 425'F oven to heat up.
Then I take a baking sheet without sides and put a piece of parchment paper on it.
After resting divide the dough in half.
keep half covered while working with the other.
Roll half out into a 12" or so circle.
Or a square the size of your pizza stone.
Transfer the dough to the parchment paper on the baking sheet.
Put some shredded mozza cheese into this.
I use part skim milk mozza that is lower in fat.
Roll out the second half of dough the same size and place on top of the first.
Roll and pinch the edge together to seal or use a fork to press together.
If one layer is shorter than the other just stretch it all out and pinch the 2 layers together.
It doesn't have to look good cause it'll be all bubbled when done.
Now poke a few holes around with a fork to release air pockets that will form between the layers.
The less you poke the more bubbled and better it will look.
I prefer to not poke holes and keep an eye on it in the oven.
If a big pocket gets out of hand poke it to release the air.
Cover the top with pizza sauce.
I like sliced tomatoes, cubed ham, and green olives.
Then top with more cheese and pop it in the over.
Slide the parchment paper off the baking sheet and right onto the hot stone.
Cook for 12-14 minutes and it's done.
Slide the parchment off the stone and back onto the sheet to take it out of the oven.
For a BBQ pizza mix half BBQ sauce with half pizza sauce.
Now fry up some cubed chicken then coat with BBQ sauce.
Use this as a topping along with onions, olives, tomatoes, mushrooms, etc -- Whatever you want.

It'll bubble up and be like something out of an Italian brick oven.

Cut cherries in half and pit them (or use a cherry pitter).
Place the cherries in a freezer-safe container and freeze for at least 3 hours prior to baking the scones.

Into the large bowl of a KitchenAid mixer (with the wire whisk attachment) or food processor, add the oat flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, ginger and salt.

Once all the wet ingredients are combined with the dry, add chopped walnuts and mix until integrated into the dough.
Taking the dough in your hands, form it into a disc shape.
Refrigerate the dough in a sealable container or plastic wrap for 1 hour.
Preheat the oven to 375 F. Pull the dough out of the refrigerator and remove the plastic wrap.
Put it on a work surface or cutting board.

Press the dough halves together to seal the cherries in.
Press the remaining frozen cherries into the top of the dough.

Mix all ingredients together and voila you have a great stir fry sauce!



Sprinkle entire roast evenly with salt and wrap with Saran Wrap.
Refrigerate overnight or up to 24 hours.
Preheat oven to 225F and place rack in center of oven.
Remove roast from fridge and pat dry with paper towels.
Using 2 teaspoons oil, coat roast evenly.
Coat entire roast with black pepper.
Using remaining oil in large, heavy skillet, brown meat on all sides.
If you eliminate this step, you will sacrifice flavor and probably wind up with an unappetizing gray roast.
Place the roast in a rack set over a roasting pan or shallow sheet pan and place in oven.
Here's the trick to the whole process.
Roast the meat until the center of the roast reaches 115F for medium rare or 125F for medium.
Don't exceed 125F for best results.
This took about 1 hour for a 2-1/2 lb roast and about 1 hr and 45 minutes for a 4 pound roast.
Don't rely entirely on times to judge doneness.
Temperature is very important here.
Once temperature is reached, turn off the oven, leaving roast undisturbed, until internal temperature reaches 130F for medium-rare and 140F for medium.
Depending on roast size, this could be anywhere from 15 minutes to and hour longer.
If the roast doesn't reach the desired temperature in a reasonable time, reheat the oven to 225F for a few minutes, turn oven off again and finish the process.
Remove roast from oven; let rest for the usual 15 minutes and slice thinly to serve.
Notes: If your roast size varies from the 4 pounds mentioned, adjust the salt and pepper accordingly.
Also, don't open the oven door any more than absolutely necessary.
A thermometer with remote sensor, that can remain in the center of the roast while it is in the oven, is a great help.
Remember, it's temperature, not time that makes this work.
Seasonings are up to you but don't neglect the initial salt as it contributes to the tenderizing process.
Because it is enzymes in the meat that help tenderize the tissues up to about 122F, keeping the temperature below this point for as long a possible improves tenderness.
