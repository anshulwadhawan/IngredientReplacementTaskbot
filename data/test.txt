Shape dough into two long "baguette" shaped loaves and place on the baking sheet.
Cover loosely with lightly oiled cling-film and leave to rise for about 30 minutes until doubled in size.
Meanwhile, place an oven proof bowl containing water on the bottom of the oven to heat up.
(About 250mls).
Sprinkle top of dough with flour, then using a sharp knife cut 5 diagonal small slits across the tops of the baguettes.
Bake for 15 minutes then reduce temperature to 190C/375F and bake for a further 10 - 15 minutes.
(If they start browning too quickly, cover loosely with foil on top.
).
Transfer to wire rack to cool.
Eat immediately.



Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Grease an aluminum baking sheet.
In a mixing bowl, combine all three ingredients and stir until the mixture has the consistency of pancake batter.
(*If the batter is too thick, add a little bit of water or meat broth.
).
Drop the batter by heaping, greased tablespoonfuls on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake the treats for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown.
Place the doggie treats on wire rack until *COMPLETELY* cooled!
For storage, refrigerate in an airtight container or "Ziploc" baggie.
Remember, these are treats, do not overfeed your dog!
Yield is estimated.



In a large bowl, toss apples with lemon juice; set aside.
In a Dutch oven over medium heat, combine sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg.
Add water; bring to a boil.
Boil for 2 minutes stirring constantly.
Add apples; return to a boil.
Reduce heat; cover and simmer until the apples are tender, about 8-10 minutes.
Place in sterilized jars and seal.



Mix ingrendients in a LARGE bowl (preferably Elvis or tiki in theme).
Enjoy.



Lightly butter the bottom of a 9 X 13 inch baking pan.
Line the pan with foil, pressing it evenly into the corners.
Lightly butter the foil.
Butter the sides of a heavy, 4-quart saucepan.
Add the sugar, 1 cup of the heavy cream, the corn syrup, butter and salt and cook over medium heat, stirring, until the butter has melted and the sugar has dissolved completely, about 5 minutes.
Bring the mixture to a boil and clip a candy thermometer to the pan.
Continue cooking at a medium boil, without stirring, until the temperature reaches 242F, 25-30 minutes.
Slowly pour in the remaining 1 cup cream, letting the mixture continue to boil; stir.
Boil without stirring until the temperature reaches 246F, about 20 minutes.
Remove the pan from heat.
Add the vanilla and stir just to blend.
Pour the caramel into the prepared pan.
Do not scrape any caramel left on the bottom of the saucepan into your prepared pan enjoy that by yourself, you deserve it!
Set the baking pan on a rack to cool, then cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for at least 4 hours or overnight.
Invert the caramel slab onto a cutting board and peel off the foil.
Using a sharp knife, score the caramel lengthwise into 9 strips and crosswise into 10.
Cut through the slab.
You will end up with 90 candies.
Wrap each candy in cellophane and store at room temperature for up to 1 week, refrigerate for up to 2 weeks, or freeze for up to 1 month.



Bring the oat flakes, water, and salt to a boil, cook till thick and creamy.
Cold to room temperature.
Combine the next ingredients and let set till bubbly (10 min).
Then add in the flours.
Knead, let rise for 1 1/2 hrs.
Knead again, let rise second time, punch down and form into loaves.
Let rise, bake at 350 degrees F for 60 min, till crust is golden and bread tests done.
NOTES : One can replace part of the wheat flour with amaranth flour in any recipe.
Try to use 1/4 amaranth flour, and see what happens.
I use this method with lots of different ingredients, just to see how they work!



Soak the cashews in a bowl of water (enough water to cover the cashews) for an hour or until soft.
Drain water from cashews.
Blend all ingredients in a food processor until smooth and creamy.



In a bowl (I use a souffle-size bowl, around 2 cups) stir together the rice flour and sugar.
While mixing with a spoon or small stiff spatula, pour in the boiling water.
Stir in clockwise direction until the lumps disappear, and the batter is slightly elasticky, about 2 minutes (note: it will become difficult to stir, but try your best anyway!
).
Cover the container with plastic wrap, and microwave on HIGH for 2-4 minutes, depending on your microwave.
Meanwhile, grease a ziploc bag well.
Invert the bag (oil side out), and remove the mochi from the bowl into the bag (you can let it cool a bit before you do this, but the more you cool it, the harder the bowl will become to clean =/).
Don't burn yourself!
While the mochi is still warm, start kneading.
To knead: Stretch and flatten the dough inside the bag with the palm of your hand, then pick up the bag at one corner, shake it so that it rolls into a ball again, then repeat.
You can also knead it by placing the mochi into a greased bowl, and knead it as you would a normal dough.
Knead for about 7~10 minutes, or to the consistency (chewiness) you want.
To prepare the coating: Process the peanuts in a blender or food processor, and spread the powder out in a plate.
Do not add sugar to the coating!
Because the sugar will dissolve with the moisture in the mochi, making it super sticky.
Pull off a teaspoonful-sized mochi ball with your hand, and coat in peanut powder.
Alternatively, if you prepared it inside a bag, cut off a 1/4" corner, and squeeze from the bag.
Separate the balls with greased scissors, or with chopsticks =P.
Enjoy!
Variations: Instead of using a coating, you could also wrap sweet red bean paste inside the mochi for daifukus =).



Preheat oven to 375F.
Butter 13 x 9 x 2-inch glass baking dish.

(Croissants, pita, tortillas, french rolls, etc.)
Enjoy!



Combine all the ingredients and mix well.



Measure concentrated cherry juice into a tall glass.
Fill glass with ginger ale and stir gently.



Puree raspberries in a blender.
Strain puree through a fine mesh sieve to separate seeds from the puree.
To help this process along, I poured the puree into the strainer and stirred with a rubber spatula, pressing against the sides of the strainer.
A spoon would also work just fine for stirring/pressing.
Return puree to the blender and add the vinegars, mustard, and salt.
Blend on low until well mixed.
With the blender running, slowly drizzle in the oil.
It is important to add the oil slowly so that an emulsion will be created, making a dressing that will not separate.
Chill for at least 2 hours for best flavor.



In a 2-quart sauce pan throw in milk, cream, rolled oats, brown sugar, and honey.
Bring to a boil and stir for 5 minutes.
